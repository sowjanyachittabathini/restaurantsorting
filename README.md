#Restaurant Gropuing

Assume you are given a JSON Array of sorted restaurants returned from a search algorithm.
The list is already sorted by distance from a given point. This list may contain the same
restaurant chain but with several different locations. For example the current list may look like
this:

Example input:

`const data = [
{ name : "Pizza Hut", location : 1, distance : 0.1 },
{ name : "Taco Bell", location : 1, distance : 0.2 },
{ name : "Pizza Hut", location : 2, distance : 0.3 },
{ name : "Taco Bell", location : 2, distance : 0.4 },
{ name : "Wendys" , location : 1, distance : 0.5 },
{ name : "Pizza Hut", location : 3, distance : 0.7 }
]`

The requirements are:
1) Group each restaurant chain together in a sub array.
2) The end result must be an array of sorted arrays, meaning the outer arrayâ€™s elements
   are sorted by the distance of the first element in each sub array.
3) Each sub array should then be sorted by distance internally.
   Example output:
   
  ` [
   [
   { name: 'Pizza Hut', location: 1, distance: 0.1 },
   { name: 'Pizza Hut', location: 2, distance: 0.3 },
   { name: 'Pizza Hut', location: 3, distance: 0.7 }
   ],
   [
   { name: 'Taco Bell', location: 1, distance: 0.2 },
   { name: 'Taco Bell', location: 2, distance: 0.4 }
   ],
   [
   { name: 'Wendys', location: 1, distance: 0.5 }
   ]
   ]`
